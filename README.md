Flicks Android app

This is an Android application for displaying list of movies in different categories - 'Now playing', 'Popular', 'Upcoming' and 'Top Rated'.

Time spent: 20 hours spent in total

Completed:

- User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

- Lists should be fully optimized for performance with the ViewHolder pattern.

- Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.

  - In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.

  - In landscape mode, the rotated layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.
  
  
The following addditional stories have been implemented:

Add pull-to-refresh for popular stream with SwipeRefreshLayout (1 point)
Display a nice default placeholder graphic for each image during loading (read more about Picasso) (1 point)
